# Github user search

## Short introduction

This is small application that allows to search Github users and see short summary of their profiles.
I have used [mobx-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/) as state management library for the first time to test its features.
You can try it [here](https://githubusersearch.pawojciechowski.ovh/).
